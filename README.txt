This is the class project of parallel computing. This project implemented the ListRanking algorithm from Joseph JaJa's book,
An Introduction to parallel Algorithms. The chapter for ListRanking Algorithm is 3.1. It is a naive implementation, and can be 
improved in many cases.


MORE TO DO: 
-make a test function to check the result;
-test kernel time seperately;
-USE "atomic write" to ensure the sychronization between blocks;
